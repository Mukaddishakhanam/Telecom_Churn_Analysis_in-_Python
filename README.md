# Telecom_Churn_Analysis_in-_Python:
This project explores the factors driving customer churn in a telecom service provider's customer base. Using visual and statistical analysis, key behavioral and demographic patterns have been uncovered to help inform customer retention strategies.
Conclusion:
This analysis highlights that churn is strongly influenced by contract length, service usage, and
tenure. Strategies such as improving onboarding for new users, bundling valued services, and
incentivizing long-term contracts can significantly improve retention.

# Key Recommendations to Reduce Churn
1. Engage New Customers Early- Focus on the first 2 months with onboarding, support, and incentives.
2. Promote Long-Term Contracts- Offer discounts or perks to shift users from monthly to yearly plans.
3. Bundle Valuable Services- Include Online Security, Tech Support, etc., to increase stickiness.
4. Discourage Electronic Check Payments- Offer rewards for switching to credit card or bank transfer.
5. Target Senior Citizens Strategically- Provide simplified plans and personalised support.
